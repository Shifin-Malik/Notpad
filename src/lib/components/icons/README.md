### Adding a New Icon

To add a new icon, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `src/lib/components/icons` directory with an appropriate name.
   The file name should be `<IconName>.svelte`.
2. Copy the icon from [Icones](https://icones.js.org/) using the website's "copy as svelte component" feature and paste it into the new icon file.
3. Import the icon in your Svelte components using the following syntax:

   ```svelte
   import TheIcon from '@/components/icons/<IconName>.svelte';
   ```
